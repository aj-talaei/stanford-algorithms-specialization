## 🧭 Specialization Overview

This rigorous four-part series dives deep into the design and analysis of algorithms, from foundational sorting and graph search methods to NP-completeness and advanced dynamic programming techniques.

| **2** | [Graph Search, Shortest Paths, and Data Structures](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-graphs-data-structures) | BFS, DFS, SCCs (Kosaraju), Dijkstra, Heaps, Union-Find |
| **3** | [Greedy Algorithms, Minimum Spanning Trees, and Dynamic Programming](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-greedy) | MST (Prim, Kruskal), Scheduling, Huffman, Knapsack, DP on paths |
| **4** | [Shortest Paths Revisited, NP-Complete Problems and What To Do About Them](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-npcomplete) | Bellman-Ford, Floyd-Warshall, Johnson’s, TSP, 2-SAT, NP-Completeness |
