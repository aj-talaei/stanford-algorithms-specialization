## ðŸ“š Topics Covered

This course explores three powerful algorithmic paradigms used in solving classic optimization problems:

### ðŸ”¹ Greedy Algorithms
- Scheduling problems: weighted sum of completion times
- Huffman coding and prefix-free compression
- Greedy choice property and optimal substructure

### ðŸ”¹ Minimum Spanning Trees (MSTs)
- Primâ€™s algorithm (heap and matrix versions)
- Kruskalâ€™s algorithm with union-find
- Applications to clustering and graph design

### ðŸ”¹ Dynamic Programming
- 0/1 Knapsack problem (table and optimized)
- Maximum-weight independent set in path graphs
- Subproblem decomposition and memoization

## ðŸ’¡ Key Takeaways

- Learned to identify and apply **greedy strategies** when local optimization leads to global optima
- Built MSTs using **Kruskal's and Prim's algorithms**, analyzing trade-offs between them
- Designed and implemented **dynamic programming** solutions for classic NP-hard problems
- Practiced **space-time optimizations** for large-scale input scenarios
- Analyzed algorithmic correctness and efficiency through **theoretical foundations and practical coding**
