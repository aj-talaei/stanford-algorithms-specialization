## ðŸ“š Topics Covered

This course dives into three major themes in modern algorithm design:

### ðŸ”¹ Advanced Graph Algorithms
- Bellman-Ford algorithm for single-source shortest paths (with negative weights)
- Floyd-Warshall algorithm for all-pairs shortest paths
- Johnson's algorithm combining Dijkstra and Bellman-Ford
- Negative cycle detection

### ðŸ”¹ NP-Completeness and Intractability
- The P vs. NP question
- Polynomial-time reductions
- Classic NP-complete problems: TSP, Vertex Cover, SAT

### ðŸ”¹ Coping with Hard Problems
- Exact algorithms for small inputs (bitmask DP)
- Greedy and local search heuristics
- Approximation algorithms with provable bounds
- 2-Satisfiability and Kosaraju's algorithm for linear-time solution
